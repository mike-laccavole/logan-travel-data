Assembling published travel data to and from Logan airport in Boston


The Masschusetts Department of Transportation collects and publishes travel data pertaining to flights arriving and departing Logan Airport. The data is published on the following website, in PDF format: https://www.massport.com/logan-airport/about-logan/airport-statistics/

Gathering this data and storing it in a pandas dataframe will require web-scraping and PDF-scraping libraries, such as bs4, PyPDF2, pdfreader and tabula.
